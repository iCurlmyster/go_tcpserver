# go_tcpserver
experimenting with some golang tcp stuff


The front end to test this server is at [this repository](https://github.com/iCurlmyster/cpp_sdl_tcp). The front end is a small graphical display using the sdl2 library and written in C++ to display moving blocks on the screen that update their position to the other users connected to the server.
